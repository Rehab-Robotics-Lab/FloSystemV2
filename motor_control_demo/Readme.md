# Motor Control Demo

## Description
This is a demo of the motor control system. It is a python script that will open a GUI window with sliders that will allow you to control the 4 motors present in the arm of the flo robot. 

## Setup
The flo_humanoid node needs to be running for this to work as it publishes messages to the /set_joint_positions topic
Remember to chmod +x the python executable before being able to run it
